<b>About this project:</b><br>
  - Leveraged ANN to develop a regression model to predict property prices based on different features such as size, condition, location, etc.<br>
  -  Performed Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering to get clean, normalized data with relevant feature to train a dense neural network build using Keras and TensorFlow.<br>
  - Deployed the model on a flask server with a wed interface/Website for execution.
